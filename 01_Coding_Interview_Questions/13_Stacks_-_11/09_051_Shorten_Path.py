##### Shorten Path #####

Write a function that takes in a non-empty string representing a valid Unix-shell 
path and returns a shortened version of that path.

A path is a notation that represents the location of a file or directory in a file 
system.

A path can be an absolute path, meaning that it starts at the root directory in a 
file system, or a relative path, meaning that it starts at the current directory 
in a file system.

In a Unix-like operating system, a path is bound by the following rules:

  * The root directory is represented by a /. This means that if a path starts 
    with /, it's an absolute path; if it doesn't, it's a relative path.

  * The symbol / otherwise represents the directory separator. This means 
    that the path /foo/bar is the location of the directory bar inside the 
    directory foo, which is itself located inside the root directory.

  * The symbol .. represents the parent directory. This means that accessing 
    files or directories in /foo/bar/.. is equivalent to accessing files or 
    directories in /foo.

  * The symbol . represents the current directory. This means that accessing 
    files or directories in /foo/bar/. is equivalent to accessing files or 
    directories in /foo/bar.

  * The symbols / and . can be repeated sequentially without consequence; 
    the symbol .. cannot, however, because repeating it sequentially means 
    going further up in parent directories. For example, /foo/bar/baz/././. 
    and /foo/bar/baz are equivalent paths, but /foo/bar/baz/../../../ and 
    /foo/bar/baz definitely aren't. The only exception is with the root 
    directory: /../../.. and / are equivalent, because the root directory 
    has no parent directory, which means that repeatedly accessing parent 
    directories does nothing.

Note that the shortened version of the path must be equivalent to the original path. 
In other words, it must point to the same file or directory as the original path.            


##### Sample Input #####
path = "/foo/../test/../test/../foo//bar/./baz"

##### Sample Output #####
"/foo/bar/baz" // This path is equivalent to the input path.


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
A path effectively consists of meaningful "tokens" (like directory names and 
symbols) that have been put together. Try transforming the string version of 
the path into a list of meaningful tokens that you can then analyze as you see 
fit.

Hint 2
Split the input path around the directory separator "/" using a native "split" 
function and try eliminating meaningless tokens from the resulting list of 
tokens. Meaningless tokens will include the empty string and the "." symbol, 
since the empty string will represent sequential "/"s, which are effectively 
useless, and the "." symbol is also effectively useless.

Hint 3
The ".." symbol essentially requires you to remove the previous token in the 
list of tokens; try using a stack to implement the logic of parsing out ".." 
symbols and the relevant parent directories.

Hint 4
You'll need to handle two edge cases: the case where the path is an absolute 
one (for this, you'll have to identify if the path starts with a "/" at the 
beginning of your algorithm and then tweak other logic accordingly) and the 
case where the path is a relative one that starts with one or multiple ".." 
symbols (in this case, you'll want to keep these symbols, since they're 
meaningful to the path).

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the pathname

##### Solution 1 #####
# O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the path

    startsWithSlash = path[0] == "/"
    tokens = filter(isImportantToken, path.split("/"))
    stack = []
    if startsWithSlash:
        stack.append("")
    for token in tokens:
        if token == "..":
            if len(stack) == 0 or stack[-1] == "..":
                stack.append(token)
            elif stack[-1] != "":
                stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(token)

    if len(stack) == 1 and stack[0] == "":
        return "/"
    return "/".join(stack)

    return len(token) > 0 and token != "."
