##### Node Swap #####

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List, swaps every pair of 
adjacent nodes in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new list), and returns its new 
head.

If the input Linked List has an odd number of nodes, its final node should remain 
the same.

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next 
node in the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least one node; in 
other words, the head will never be None / null.


##### Sample Input #####
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 // the head node with value 0    


##### Sample Output #####
1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 // the new head node with value 1  


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
Each node in the linked list points to the next node in the linked list. 
How would you modify the next pointers of two nodes in order to swap them?

Hint 2
Can you apply what you come up with from Hint #1 in order to solve this 
problem recursively?

Hint 3
To solve this problem recursively, have each recursive call swap a pair of 
nodes and then return the first node of the swapped pair (the node that was 
originally the second node in the pair). Also, have each recursive call make 
the second node of the swapped pair (the node that was originally the first 
node in the pair) point to the result of the next recursive call. The next 
recursive call should take in the first node of the next pair as its input 
parameter.

Hint 4
Implementing this problem iteratively can improve the space complexity 
of the solution. Intuitively, you need to swap nodes while traversing the 
entire linked list. To do this, you'll need to reference and change the 
pointers of three nodes at a time. You'll also need to create a placeholder 
node that points to the head of the linked list, so that at the end of the 
traversal, you can still reference the new head that you have to return.

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Linked List
