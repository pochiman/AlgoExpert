##### Solve Sudoku #####

You're given a two-dimensional array that represents a 9x9 partially filled Sudoku 
board. Write a function that returns the solved Sudoku board.

Sudoku is a famous number-placement puzzle in which you need to fill a 9x9 grid 
with integers in the range of 1-9. Each 9x9 Sudoku board is split into 9 3x3 
subgrids, as seen in the illustration below, and starts out partially filled.

- - 3 | - 2 - | 6 - -
9 - - | 3 - 5 | - - 1
- - 1 | 8 - 6 | 4 - -
- - - - - - - - - - -
- - 8 | 1 - 2 | 9 - -
7 - - | - - - | - - 8
- - 6 | 7 - 8 | 2 - -
- - - - - - - - - - -
- - 2 | 6 - 9 | 5 - -
8 - - | 2 - 3 | - - 9
- - 5 | - 1 - | 3 - -

The objective is to fill the grid such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid 
contains the numbers 1-9 exactly once. In other words, no row may contain the 
same digit more than once, no column may contain the same digit more than once, 
and none of the 9 3x3 subgrids may contain the same digit more than once.

Your input for this problem will always be a partially filled 9x9 two-dimensional 
array that represents a solvable Sudoku puzzle. Every element in the array will 
be an integer in the range of 0-9, where a 0 represents an empty square that must 
be filled by your algorithm.

Note that you may modify the input array and that there will always be exactly 
one solution to each input Sudoku board.


##### Sample Input #####
board = 
[
  [7, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0], 
  [6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9], 
  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 7, 8], 
  [0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 6, 0], 
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 9, 3, 0], 
  [9, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5], 
  [0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2], 
  [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 0], 
  [0, 4, 9, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7], 
]

##### Sample Output #####
[
  [7, 8, 5, 4, 3, 9, 1, 2, 6], 
  [6, 1, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 4, 9], 
  [4, 9, 3, 6, 2, 1, 5, 7, 8], 
  [8, 5, 7, 9, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1], 
  [2, 6, 1, 7, 5, 8, 9, 3, 4], 
  [9, 3, 4, 1, 6, 2, 7, 8, 5], 
  [5, 7, 8, 3, 9, 4, 6, 1, 2], 
  [1, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7, 4, 9, 3], 
  [3, 4, 9, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 7], 
]


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
The brute-force approach to this problem is to generate every possible Sudoku 
board and to check each one until you find one that's valid. The issue with 
this approach is that there are 9^81 possible 9x9 Sudoku boards. This is an 
extremely large number, which makes it practically impossible to take this 
approach. How can you avoid generating every possible Sudoku board?

Hint 2
Keep in mind that a Sudoku board doesn't need to be entirely filled to figure 
out if it's invalid and won't lead to a solution. Try generating partially 
filled Sudoku boards until they become invalid, thereby abandoning solutions 
that will never lead to a properly solved board.

Hint 3
The method described in Hint #2 is more formally known as backtracking. 
This involves attempting to place digits into empty positions in the Sudoku 
board and checking at each insertion if that newly inserted digit makes the 
Sudoku board invalid. If it does, then you try to insert another digit until 
you find one that doesn't invalidate the board. If it doesn't invalidate the 
board, you temporarily place that digit and continue to try to solve the rest 
of the board. If you ever reach a position where there are no valid digits to 
be inserted (every digit placed in that position leads to an invalid board), 
that means that one of the previously inserted digits is incorrect. Thus, you 
must backtrack and change previously placed digits. For more details on this 
approach, refer to the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video 
explanation.
