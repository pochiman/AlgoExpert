##### Reverse Linked List #####

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List, reverses the 
list in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new list), and returns its new head.

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to 
the next node in the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least one node; 
in other words, the head will never be None / null.


##### Sample Input #####
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 // the head node with value 0

##### Sample Output #####
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 // the new head node with value 5


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
You can iterate through the Linked List from head to tail and reverse it 
in place along the way.

Hint 2
You'll need to manipulate three nodes at once at every step.

Hint 3
Imagine you have three variables pointing to three consecutive nodes in a 
Linked List.  Start by setting the "next" property of the second node to 
the first node.  Then, set the first variable to the second node, and set 
the second variable to the third node.  Finally, set the third variable to 
the second variable's "next" property (at this point, the second variable 
is the original third node).  Repeat this process until you're at the tail 
of the Linked List.

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Linked List

##### Solution 1 #####
# This is an input class.  Do not edit.
class LinkedList:
  def __init__(self, value):
    self.value = value
    self.next = None


# O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Linked List
def reverseLinkedList(head):
  previousNode, currentNode = None, head
  while currentNode is not None:
    nextNode = currentNode.next
    currentNode.next = previousNode
    previousNode = currentNode
    currentNode = nextNode
  return previousNode
