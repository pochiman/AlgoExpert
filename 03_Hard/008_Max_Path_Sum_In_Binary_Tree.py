##### Max Path Sum in Binary Tree #####

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum.

A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected 
to more than two other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes 
in a particular path.

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child 
node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.


##### Sample Input #####
tree =  1  
     /     \ 
    2       3
  /   \   /   \ 
 4     5 6     7

##### Sample Output #####
18 // 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 7


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
If you were to imagine each node in a Binary Tree as the root of the Binary 
Tree, temporarily eliminating all of the nodes that come above it, how would 
you find the max path sum for each of these newly imagined Binary Trees? 
In simpler terms, how can you find the max path sum for each subtree in the 
Binary Tree?

Hint 2
For every node in a Binary Tree, there are four options for the max path sum 
that includes its value: the node's value alone, the node's value plus the max 
path sum of its left subtree, the node's value plus the max path sum of its 
right subtree, or the node's value plus the max path sum of both its subtrees.

Hint 3
A recursive algorithm that computes each node's max path sum and uses it to 
compute its parents' nodes' max path sums seems appropriate, but realize that 
you cannot have a path going through a node and both its subtrees as well as 
that node's parent node. In other words, the fourth option mentioned in Hint 
#2 poses a challenge to implementing a recursive algorithm that solves this 
problem. How can you get around it?

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree

##### Solution 1 #####
# O(n) time | O(log(n)) space

  maxChildSumAsBranch = max(leftMaxSumAsBranch, rightMaxSumAsBranch)

  value = tree.value
  maxSumAsBranch = max(maxChildSumAsBranch + value, value)
  maxSumAsRootNode = max(leftMaxSumAsBranch + value + rightMaxSumAsBranch, maxSumAsBranch)
  maxPathSum = max(leftMaxPathSum, rightMaxPathSum, maxSumAsRootNode)
    
  return (maxSumAsBranch, maxPathSum)
