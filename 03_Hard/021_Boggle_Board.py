##### Boggle Board #####

You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height 
and width containing letters; this matrix represents a boggle board.  You're 
also given a list of words.

Write a function that returns an array of all the words contained in the boggle 
board.  The final words don't need to be in any particular order.

A word is constructed in the boggle board by connecting adjacent (horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally) letters, without using any single letter at a given 
position more than once; while a word can of course have repeated letters, those 
repeated letters must come from different positions in the boggle board in order 
for the word to be contained in the board.  Note that two or more words are 
allowed to overlap and use the same letters in the boggle board.


##### Sample Input #####
board = [
  ["t", "h", "i", "s", "i", "s", "a"], 
  ["s", "i", "m", "p", "l", "e", "x"], 
  ["b", "x", "x", "x", "x", "e", "b"], 
  ["x", "o", "g", "g", "l", "x", "o"], 
  ["x", "x", "x", "D", "T", "r", "a"], 
  ["R", "E", "P", "E", "A", "d", "x"], 
  ["x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "x", "x"], 
  ["N", "O", "T", "R", "E", "-", "P"], 
  ["x", "x", "D", "E", "T", "A", "E"], 
],
words = [
  "this", "is", "not", "a", "simple", "boggle", 
  "board", "test", "REPEATED", "NOTRE-PEATED", 
]

##### Sample Output #####
["this", "is", "a", "simple", "boggle", "board", "NOTRE-PEATED"]
// The words could be ordered differently.


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
You can divide this question into two separate problems: one part involves 
traversing the boggle board in such a way that allows you to construct strings 
letter by letter; the other part involves actually comparing the strings you 
construct in the board against the words in the list that you're given.  For the 
second part, what data structure lends itself very well to matching characters 
to multiple strings at once?

Hint 2
Try creating a trie out of the input list of words.  This will allow you to 
compare letters in the boggle board against all input words in constant time.  
How can you efficiently traverse the boggle board to construct all potentially 
valid strings, without counting letters twice in any string?

Hint 3
Treat the board as a graph, where each element in the board is a node with 
up to 8 neighboring nodes.  Traverse it in a depth-first-search-like fashion, 
checking if letters are contained in the trie and traversing the trie 
simultaneously if it makes sense to do so.  How can you keep track of letters 
that you've already visited in order to avoid erroneously counting some of 
them twice in a single string?  Could you keep track of visited nodes in an 
auxiliary data structure?

Hint 4
Keeping in mind that you only want to mark nodes as visited in a single branch 
of the graph that you're traversing (i.e., you don't want the state of visited 
nodes in one branch of the graph to spill into the state of another branch of 
the graph), try marking any node you traverse as unvisited at the end of the 
recursive call that actually traverses it, after traversing through all of 
the node's neighbors and performing the same actions on them recursively.

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(nm*8^s + ws) time | O(nm + ws) space - where n is the width of the board, 
m is the height of the board, w is the number of words, and s is the length 
of the longest word
