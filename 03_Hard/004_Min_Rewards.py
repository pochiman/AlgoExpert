##### Min Rewards #####

Imagine that you're a teacher who's just graded the final exam in a class.  You have 
a list of student scores on the final exam in a particular order (not necessarily 
sorted), and you want to reward your students.  You decide to do so fairly by giving 
them arbitrary rewards following two rules:

  1. All students must receive at least one reward.

  2. Any given student must receive strictly more rewards than an adjacent student 
     (a student immediately to the left or to the right) with a lower score and must 
     receive strictly fewer rewards than an adjacent student with a higher score.

Write a function that takes in a list of scores and returns the minimum number of 
rewards that you must give out to students to satisfy the two rules.

You can assume that all students have different scores; in other words, the scores 
are all unique.


##### Sample Input #####
scores = [8, 4, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 5]

##### Sample Output #####
25 // you would give out the following rewards: [4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
You could try iterating through the input list of scores and incrementing the 
number of rewards you give to each student if they have a greater score than 
the previous student's score.  However, if you reach a student with a smaller 
score than the previous student's score, you'll have to backtrack through the 
array to fix previous reward assignments.  During this backtrack, is it correct 
to simply increment the reward of a student whose score is greater than the 
next student's score?

Hint 2
Notice that there are local mins and local maxes in the input list of scores: 
scores that are smaller than both scores next to them and scores that are greater 
than both scores next to them.  Find the local mins, and try expanding away from 
them until you reach local maxes, assigning (and incrementing) rewards as you go.

Hint 3
Do you actually need to find the local mins mentioned in Hint #2?  Can you simply 
do two sweeps of the input list of scores, one from left to right, and one from 
right to left?

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
