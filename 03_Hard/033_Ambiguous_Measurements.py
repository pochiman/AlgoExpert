##### Ambiguous Measurements #####

This problem deals with measuring cups that are missing important measuring 
labels.  Specifically, a measuring cup only has two measuring lines, a Low (L) 
line and a High (H) line.  This means that these cups can't precisely measure 
and can only guarantee that the substance poured into them will be between the 
L and H line.  For example, you might have a measuring cup that has a Low line 
at 400ml and a high line at 435ml.  This means that when you use this measuring 
cup, you can only be sure that what you're measuring is between 400ml and 435ml.

You're given a list of measuring cups containing their low and high lines as 
well as one low integer and one high integer representing a range for a target 
measurement.  Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether you 
can use the cups to accurately measure a volume in the specified [low, high] 
range (the range is inclusive).

Note that:

  * Each measuring cup will be represented by a pair of positive integers 
    [L, H], where 0 <= L <= H.

  * You'll always be given at least one measuring cup, and the low and high 
    input parameters will always satisfy the following constraint:
    0 <= low <= high.

  * Once you've measured some liquid, it will immediately be transferred to a 
    larger bowl that will eventually (possibly) contain the target measurement.

  * You can't pour the contents of one measuring cup into another cup.      


##### Sample Input #####
measuringCups = [
  [200, 210], 
  [450, 465], 
  [800, 850], 
]
low = 2100
high = 2300

##### Sample Output #####
true
// We use cup [450, 465] to measure four volumes:
// First measurement: Low = 450, High = 465
// Second measurement: Low = 450 + 450 = 900, High = 465 + 465 = 930
// Third measurement: Low = 900 + 450 = 1350, High = 930 + 465 = 1395
// Fourth measurement: Low = 1350 + 450 = 1800, High = 1395 + 465 = 1860

// Then we use cup [200, 210] to measure two volumes:
// Fifth measurement: Low = 1800 + 200 = 2000, High = 1860 + 210 = 2070
// Sixth measurement: Low = 2000 + 200 = 2200, High = 2070 + 210 = 2280

// We've measured a volume in the range [2200, 2280].
// This is within our target range, so we return `true`.

// Note: there are other ways to measure a volume in the target range.


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
Start by considering the last cup that you'll use in your sequence of 
measurements.  If it isn't possible to use any of the cups as the last 
cup, then you can't measure the desired volume.

Hint 2
If the cup that you're going to use last has a measuring range of [100, 110] 
and you want to measure in the range of [500, 550], then after you pick this 
cup as the last cup, you need to measure a range of [400, 440].  Now, you 
can simply pick the last cup you'll use to measure this new range.  If you 
continue these steps, you'll eventually know if you're able to measure the 
entire range or not.

Hint 3
Hint #2 should give you an idea of how to solve this problem recursively.  
Try every cup as the last cup for the starting range, then recursively try 
to measure the new ranges created after using the selected last cups.  If 
you ever reach a point where one cup can measure the entire range, then 
you're finished and you can measure the target range.  Try to think of a 
way to optimize this recursive approach, since it might involve a lot of 
repeated calculations.
