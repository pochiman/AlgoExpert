##### Lowest Common Manager #####

You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an OrgChart class that 
have a directReports property pointing to their direct reports. The first input 
is the top manager in an organizational chart (i.e., the only instance that 
isn't anybody else's direct report), and the other two inputs are reports 
in the organizational chart. The two reports are guaranteed to be distinct.

Write a function that returns the lowest common manager to the two reports.


##### Sample Input #####
// From the organizational chart below.
topManager = Node A
reportOne = Node E
reportTwo = Node I
          A
       /     \ 
      B       C
    /   \   /   \ 
   D     E F     G
 /   \ 
H     I

##### Sample Output #####
Node B


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
Given a random subtree in the organizational chart, the manager at the 
root of that subtree is common to any two reports in the subtree.

Hint 2
Knowing Hint #1, the lowest common manager to two reports in an 
organizational chart is the root of the lowest subtree containing those 
two reports. Find that lowest subtree to find the lowest common manager.

Hint 3
To find the lowest subtree containing both of the input reports, try 
recursively traversing the organizational chart and keeping track of the 
number of those reports contained in each subtree as well as the lowest 
common manager in each subtree. Some subtrees might contain neither of 
the two reports, some might contain one of them, and other might contain 
both; the first to contain both should return the lowest common manager 
for all of the subtrees above it that contain it, including the entire 
organizational chart.
