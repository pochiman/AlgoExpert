##### Breadth-first Search #####

You're given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children 
nodes.  When put together, nodes form an acyclic tree-like structure.

Implement the breadthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes 
in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Breadth-first Search approach 
(specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores all of the nodes' 
names in the input array, and returns it.

If you're unfamiliar with Breadth-first Search, we recommend watching the 
Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting 
to code.


##### Sample Input #####
graph =    A 
       /   |   \ 
      B    C    D   
     / \       / \ 
    E   F     G   H
       / \     \ 
      I   J     K

##### Sample Output #####
["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K"]


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
The Breadth-first Search algorithm works by traversing a graph level by level.
In other words, before traversing any Node's children Nodes, its sibling 
nodes must be traversed.  How can you simply and effectively keep track of 
Nodes' children Nodes as you traverse them, all the while retaining the 
order in which you must traverse them?

Hint 2
Try using a queue to store all of the future Nodes that you will need to 
explore as you traverse the graph.  By adding Nodes' children Nodes to the 
queue every time you explore them and by using the First-In-First-Out 
property of the queue, you can traverse the graph in a Breadth-first Search 
way.  Don't forget to add every Node's name to the input array as you 
traverse the graph.

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(v + e) time | O(v) space - where v is the number of vertices of the input 
graph and e is the number of edges of the input graph

##### Solution 1 #####
# Do not edit the class below except
# for the breadthFirstSearch method.
# Feel free to add new properties
# and methods to the class.
class Node:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.children = []

  def addChild(self, name):
    self.children.append(Node(name))
    return self

  # O(v + e) time | O(v) space
  def breadthFirstSearch(self, array):
    queue = [self]
    while len(queue) > 0:
      current = queue.pop(0)
      array.append(current.name)
      for child in current.children:
        queue.append(child)
    return array
