# Balance Index [Summary]

We can solve this question in three different ways, each more optimal than the previous.

# [Least_Optimal_Solution]

We can iterate through the array once, and at each index, iterate through the left side and right side of the current index to compute the `leftSideSum` and `rightSideSum`.

If the two sums are ever equal to each other, we've found the balance index.

This solution has us iterate through the entire array at every index of the array; therefore, it runs in `O(n^2)` time, where n is the length of the array.

# [More_Optimal_Solution]

Instead of using nested `for` loops to calculate the `leftSideSum`s and `rightSideSum`s, we can compute them trivially by iterating through the array twice: once from left to right for the `leftSideSum`s, and once from right to left for the `rightSideSum`s.

By initializing the two sums to `0`, all that we have to do is to increment the sums at each index with the current number in the array; this gives us the relevant sum for the next index.

While this solution lets us avoid the nested loops, which improves the time complexity of our algorithm to linear time, it does require us to store at least the `leftSideSum`s in an auxiliary array, forcing us to use linear space.

# [Most_Optimal_Solution]

For the most optimal solution, we have to realize that both the `leftSideSum`s and the `rightSideSum`s can be computed in a single pass through the array, without needing to store an entire auxiliary array of values.

To do this, we initialize the `leftSideSum` to `0` and the `rightSideSum` to the sum of the values in the array, which is precomputed trivially with one pass through the array.

Then, we iterate through the array, and at each index we decrement the `rightSideSum` and increment the `leftSideSum` by the value of the current number. We also check for equality of the two sums, and we make sure to sequence these three operations correctly.

Since we only do a total of two passes through the array and store just a few variables, this solution runs in linear time and with constant space.

# [Complexity_Analysis]

As detailed above, the optimal solution to this problem runs in linear time and with constant space.

# [Closing_Thoughts]

One of the easiest ways to solve this problem optimally is to start with the naive solution and to work your way through optimizations.
