# Longest Streak Of Adjacent Ones [Summary]

We can solve this question in one pass through the array. To do so, we'll need to keep track of four variables:

  1. The length of the longest streak of `1`s.
  2. The index of the replaced `0` that yields the longest streak of `1`s.
  3. The length of the current streak of `1`s.
  4. The index of the currently replaced `0`.

As we iterate through the array, we treat every `0` that we encounter as the current `0` to replace. This means that, whenever we encounter a `0`, we set the length of the current streak to `index - replacedZeroIdx` (this is the stretch of `1`s between the previous `0` and the current `0`) before updating the index of the replaced `0` to the index that we're at.

Whenever we encounter a `1`, we increment the length of the current streak of `1`s, and regardless of what value we encounter, we check if we have to update the two variables for the longest streak of `1`s by comparing the length of the current streak to the length of the longest streak.

This question is self-evidently solved in linear time and with constant space.

# [Closing_Thoughts]

The algorithm behind this problem's optimal solution is tricky; it's important to walk through to an example and to ask yourself what exact information you have whenever you encounter a `0`. This leads you to the algorithm presented above.

The sequencing of operations in the solution's `for` loop is also very important.
