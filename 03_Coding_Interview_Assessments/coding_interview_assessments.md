# 4 Coding Interview Assessments

Our set of practice tests to complete your coding interview prep.

As close as you'll get to a real day of coding interviews.

These assessments are meant to reflect a real day of coding interviews. We recommend completing each assessment in a single 4-hour sitting, with a 1-hour break in the middle.
(2 questions | break | 2 questions)

While you can choose to complete questions in any order, there's no reason not to follow the provided orders.

Assessments are difficult. We recommend completing 75-100 normal AlgoExpert questions first.
