##### Task Assignment #####

You're given an integer k representing a number of workers and an array of 
positive integers representing durations of tasks that must be completed by the 
workers.  Specifically, each worker must complete two unique tasks and can only 
work on one task at a time.  The number of tasks will always be equal to 2k such 
that each worker always has exactly two tasks to complete.  All tasks are 
independent of one another and can be completed in any order.  Workers will 
complete their assigned tasks in parallel, and the time taken to complete all 
tasks will be equal to the time taken to complete the longest pair of tasks 
(see the sample output for an explanation).

Write a function that returns the optimal assignment of tasks to each worker such 
that the tasks are completed as fast as possible.  Your function should return a 
list of pairs, where each pair stores the indices of the tasks that should be 
completed by one worker.  The pairs should be in the following format: [task1, 
task2], where the order of task1 and task2 doesn't matter.  Your function can return 
the pairs in any order.  If multiple optimal assignments exist, any correct answer 
will be accepted.

Note: you'll always be given at least one worker (i.e., k will always be greater 
than 0).


##### Sample Input #####
k = 3
tasks = [1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4]

##### Sample Output #####
[
  [0, 2], // tasks[0] = 1, tasks[2] = 5 | 1 + 5 = 6
  [4, 5], // tasks[4] = 1, tasks[5] = 4 | 1 + 4 = 5
  [1, 3], // tasks[1] = 3, tasks[3] = 3 | 3 + 3 = 6
] // The fastest time to complete all tasks is 6.

// Note: there are multiple correct answers for this sample input.
// The following is an example of another correct answer:
// [
//   [2, 4], 
//   [0, 5], 
//   [1, 3] 
// ]


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
Start by considering which pairs of tasks will lead to the longest possible 
time to complete all tasks.

Hint 2
The amount of time it'll take to complete all tasks will be dictated by the pair 
of tasks that has the longest total duration.  This means that you'll want to 
avoid pairing long tasks together. 

Hint 3
Since the pair of tasks with the longest total duration is the time it takes for 
us to finish all tasks, we want to minimize this pair's duration.  To do this, we 
can simply pair the shortest-duration task with the longest-duration task and 
repeat the process with all other tasks.

Hint 4
Start by sorting the tasks array in ascending order.  Then, pair the shortest-
duration task with the longest-duration task, and add that pair to some output 
array.  Repeat this process until you've paired all tasks.  This will lead to 
an optimal pairing, because your pair of tasks with the longest duration will 
have the shortest duration that it can possible have.

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(nlog(n)) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of tasks
