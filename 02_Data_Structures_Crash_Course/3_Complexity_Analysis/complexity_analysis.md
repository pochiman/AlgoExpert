# 3 - Complexity Analysis

Two dimensions, time and space, diverged in a yellow wood, and Iâ€”
I watched the Complexity Analysis video on AlgoExpert,
And that has made all the difference (in my coding interviews).

# Key Terms

# [Complexity_Analysis]
The process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the `time complexity` and the `space complexity` of an algorithm.

Complexity analysis is effectively used to determine how "good" an algorithm is and whether it's "better" than another one.

# [Time_Complexity]
A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.

It's expressed using `Big O` notation.

# [Space_Complexity]
A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.

It's expressed using `Big O` notation.
