##### Minimum Area Rectangle #####

You're given an array of points plotted on a 2D graph (the xy-plane). Write a 
function that returns the minimum area of any rectangle that can be formed using any 
4 of these points such that the rectangle's sides are parallel to the x and y axes 
(i.e., only rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides should be considered--no 
rectangles with diagonal sides). If no rectangle can be formed, your function should 
return 0.

The input array will contain points represented by arrays of two integers [x, y]. 
The input array will never contain duplicate points.


##### Sample Input #####
points = 
[
  [1, 5], 
  [5, 1], 
  [4, 2], 
  [2, 4], 
  [2, 2], 
  [1, 2], 
  [4, 5], 
  [2, 5], 
  [-1, -2], 
]

##### Sample Output #####
3
// The rectangle with corners [1, 5], [2, 5], [1, 2], and [2, 2] 
// has the minimum area: 3.


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
The brute-force approach to this problem is to simply generate all possible 
combinations of 4 points and to see if they form a rectangle. You can calculate 
the area of all of these rectangles and then return the minimum area that you 
find. Is there a better approach than this?

Hint 2
A more optimal approach is to find vertical or horizontal edges that are 
parallel to the y or x axes, respectively. If you find two parallel edges (two 
vertical edges, for example) that share a vertical or horizontal coordinate (y 
values in the case of vertical edges), then those edges form a rectangle.

Hint 3
Another approach is to pick any two points that don't have the same x or y values 
(i.e., points that could be at opposite ends of a rectangle diagonal) and to see if 
you can create a rectangle with them and two other points. Given two points where 
p1 = (x1, y1) and p2 = (x2, y2), if points p3 = (x1, y2) and p4 = (x2, y1) exist, 
then these 4 points form a rectangle.

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n^2) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of points
