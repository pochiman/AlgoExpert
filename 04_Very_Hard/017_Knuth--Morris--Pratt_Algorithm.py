##### Knuth--Morris--Pratt Algorithm #####

Write a function that takes in two strings and checks if the first string contains 
the second one using the Knuth--Morris--Pratt algorithm. The function should return 
a boolean.

If you're unfamiliar with the Knuth--Morris--Pratt Algorithm, we recommend watching 
the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting 
to code.


##### Sample Input #####
string = "aefoaefcdaefcdaed"
substring = "aefcdaed"

##### Sample Output #####
true


##### Hints #####

Hint 1
The Knuth--Morris--Pratt algorithm works by identifying patterns in the 
potential substring and exploiting them to avoid doing needless character 
comparisons when searching for the substring in the main string. For instance, 
take the string "ababac" and the substring "abac"; comparing these strings will 
fail at the fourth character, where "b" is not equal to "c". Instead of having 
to restart our comparisons at the second character of the main string, however, 
we notice that the substring "ab", which is at the beginning of our potential 
substring, just appeared near our point of failure in the main string. How can 
we use this to our advantage?

Hint 2
Start by traversing the potential substring and building out a pattern table. 
This 1-dimensional array should store, for every position in the substring, the 
last index at which a matching pattern has been seen; more specifically, this 
index should be the ending index of a prefix in the substring that is also a 
suffix at the given position. For example, the string "abcababcd" should yield 
the following pattern table: [-1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, -1].

Hint 3
After the pattern table mentioned in Hint #2 has been built, traverse the 
main string and the potential substring with two separate pointers. When 
characters match, move the pointers forward. When characters don't match, 
check if the pointer in the substring is at the very beginning of the substring; 
if it is, then there is no match and you can move the pointer of the main string 
forward until there is a match; if it isn't, then move it to the position that 
comes right after the last seen pattern stored at the previous index in the 
pattern table.

Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n + m) time | O(m) space - where n is the length of the main string and m is 
the length of the potential substring.
